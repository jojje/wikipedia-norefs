# Wikipedia NoRefs web extension

This is a simple extension for hiding and showing wikipedia references.

By default the extension hides references to improve wikipedia article readability. For the few times you actually want to check a reference, just click the extension icon and they will appear again.

_Note: the extension only activates and appears on wikipedia wiki pages, so if you're not seeing it, visit [such a page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive)._
